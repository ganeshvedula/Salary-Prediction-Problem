# Salary-Prediction-Problem
The purpose of this challenge is to “tell a data story about a subset of the data science community represented in this survey, through a combination of both narrative text and data exploration.”

# Purpose of the project
1) understand and explore employment in the data science community, as represented in a survey conducted by Kaggle.
2) train, validate, and tune multiple regressors that can predict, given a set of survey responses by a data scientist, what a survey respondent’s current yearly compensation is.
